## First release / Beta version coming soon!

## About
CERRES (Chemical Reaction and Reactor Engineering Simulations) is a program designed for the simulation of various types of chemical reactors under different operating conditions with user-supplied chemistry, allowing for complex bulk and surface reaction (micro)kinetics. Furthermore, it provides additional modes of operation such as the comparison of the model results to experimentally measured values and reaction rate parameter optimization (fitting). The main goals of the software are computing efficiency, ease of use and wide functionality. CERRES is being developed by Damjan Lašič Jurković at the Department of Catalysis and Chemical Reaction Engineering at the National Institute of Chemistry in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

CERRES is and will remain free for any academic or personal use, we only require the users to cite the main CERRES paper (DOI:XXXXX) in any scientific publications containing results obtained by CERRES. Please see the license for more information.

We are always happy to receive any feedback, comments, bug reports or suggestions for additional features!
